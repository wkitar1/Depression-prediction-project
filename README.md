# The Link Between Depression and Demographic, Academic, and Lifestyle Factors

This project explores the primary factors contributing to depression among students by analyzing demographic, academic, and lifestyle variables. The goal is to identify key risk factors that influence student mental health and propose preventive strategies based on the findings.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Tool Used**: Weka (J48 Decision Tree Classifier)
- **Dataset**: [Depression Student Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikynahidwin/depression-student-dataset)
- **Algorithm**: Supervised Learning – J48 Classifier Tree
- **Focus Areas**: Mental health, academic pressure, financial stress, sleep, diet, and study satisfaction

## 🧪 Methodology

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values)
- Applied a J48 decision tree algorithm using Weka
- Analyzed patterns and feature importance in predicting depression
- Interpreted results to provide meaningful recommendations

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Suicidal thoughts** were the strongest indicator of depression
- High **academic pressure** and **financial stress** significantly increase depression risk
- Low **study satisfaction**, poor **sleep duration**, and **unhealthy diet** were also major contributors

## 📝 Conclusion

Students facing academic and financial burdens, combined with low study satisfaction and poor lifestyle habits, are more prone to depression. Support systems targeting these risk factors could help reduce depression rates and improve student well-being.
